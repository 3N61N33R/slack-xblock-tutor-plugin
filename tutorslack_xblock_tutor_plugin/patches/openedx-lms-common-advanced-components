# This patch ensures ADVANCED_COMPONENT_TYPES is correctly extended for Studio.
# It targets the LMS settings as Studio is part of the LMS.
# It's important to merge with existing components, not overwrite them.

# First, ensure that ADVANCED_COMPONENT_TYPES is defined.
# It typically is, but this handles cases where it might not be.
